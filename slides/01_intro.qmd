## Grading
- Assistance and participation: 50% - come _prepared_ to participate
- Assignments: 40% (n = 4; 10% each, graded as completed / not completed)
- Final presentation / Data Science portfolio: 10%

## The (general) instruction format

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
#### Lecture sessions (Tuesdays)
- Slide-based delivery of content
- Emphasis on the _why_ of an approach
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
#### Hands-on sessions (Thursdays)
- No slides, mostly live coding (you follow along)
- Emphasis on _how_ of an approach
- Expect the first sessions to be rocky as you get up to speed and we standardize our computers

# Introduction to Data Science

This course only covers one bubble

## How will we approach data science?

#### How we'll learn things

- Organization
- Visualization
- Reproducibility
- Data management, transformation, wrangling
- Spatial data and other extensions
- **No modelling!**
- **No communication**(-ish)

:::

::::

## Our toolkit

- [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) will be our _software environment for statistical computing_
- [**RStudio**](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) will be our _Integrated Development Environment_ (IDE)
- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/) will help us keep track of our code
- [**GitHub**](https://github.com/) will allow us to share our code with the world
- [EVR628tools](https://jcvdav.github.io/EVR628tools/) contains data and a few functions to support the course

. . .

# You should have already done this
::: {.nonincremental}
- Download and install the latest version of R (currently v 4.5.x) for [MacOS](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) or [Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
- Download and install the latest version of [RStudio Desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
- Full set of instructions available [here](https://jcvdav.github.io/EVR_628/docs/01_installing_R_RStudio.html).

# Let's jump in

## Learning objectives

:::{.callout-note}
# By the end of this week, you should be able to:
- Open RStudio
- Identify the main work areas
- Start a project and a script
- Install packages
:::

## Getting to know R Studio

## Why RStudio

- IDE
- Cognitive costs of switching between screens
- There are other solutions

## RStudio projects

- One folder = one project

## R Scripts

## Hands-on tasks:
