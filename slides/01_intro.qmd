## Grading
- Assistance and participation: 50% - come _prepared_ to participate
- Assignments: 40% (n = 4; 10% each, graded as completed / not completed)
- Final presentation / Data Science portfolio: 10%

## The (General) Instruction Format

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
#### Lecture sessions (Tuesdays)
- Slide-based delivery of content
- Emphasis on the _why_ of an approach
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
#### Hands-on sessions (Thursdays)
- No slides, mostly live coding (you follow along)
- Emphasis on _how_ of an approach
- Expect the first sessions to be rocky as you get up to speed and we standardize our computers

:::

::::

. . .

::: {.callout-important}
Make sure to complete assigned readings or software installation _before_ class. This will count towards participation.
:::

## Interactions with Me

- Office hours: Thursdays 10:15-12:00
- Via email, please include `EVR628` in your subject heading

## Adaptive Approach

- About three weeks in I will poll you (anonymously)
- Then again 5 weeks in (anonymously)
- Speed things up? Slow things down?
- Are materials relevant to you?

## Quick Notes on Using These Slides

## Things you will be able to build

You will learn how to access, work with, and visualize many different types of environmental data. For example:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='50%'}
- **Access** public data repositories and build **animated visualizations**
- Track fishing vessels form space and build maps of fishing activity
- Develop [interactive web-based apps]( https://682wxr-juan0carlos-villasenor0derbez.shinyapps.io/gom_fishing/) to allow others explore your data
- Create [slides with interactive content](https://jcvdav.github.io/EVR_662/slides/02_data_models_vector#/example-rosenstiel) for effective communication

## How will we approach data science?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

**How we think about projects**

![Modified from @Wickham2023-aa](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/diagrams/data-science/base.png){.nostretch fig-align="center" width="95%"}

- Maybe also add "collect" before "import"

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

**How we'll learn things**

- Organization (Weeks 1, 3, 4, 6)
- Visualization (Weeks 2, 5, 11)
- Reproducibility (Weeks 3, and throughout)
- Data management, transformation, wrangling (Weeks 6-9, 11)
- Spatial data, programming, and other extensions (Week 10 - 14)
- **No modelling!**
- **No communication**(-ish)

Introduction to Data Science

## Learning Objectives

:::{.callout-note}
# By the end of this week, you should be able to:
- Understand the difference between R and RStudio
- Open the RStudio IDE
- Identify the main work areas
- Start a project and a script
- Install R packages
:::

## What is Data Science?

```{r, echo = T, folding = T}
#| fig-width: 4
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-cap: "Conceptual model of data science"
library(tidyverse)
library(ggrepel)

tibble(skill = c("Coding", "Stats", "Domain"),
       x = c(-1, 1, 0),
       y = c(1, 1, -1)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, label = skill, color = skill)) +
  geom_point(size = 100, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_text(mapping = aes(label = skill),
            color = "black",
            nudge_x = c(-2, 2, 0),
            nudge_y = c(0.5, 0.5, -2)) +
  geom_text(x = 0, y = 0, label = "Data Science",
            color = "black") +
  coord_equal() +
  lims(x = c(-4, 4),
       y = c(-4, 4)) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
. . .

This course only covers one bubble: Talking to your computer



## Side note #2:  A word of caution

- This will feel weird
- It will be painful

. . .

BUT!

- It _should_ feel weird
- You are not alone; leverage resources:
  - Me
  - Your TA
  - Each other
  - LLMs
- It will be worth it
- If we have to slow things down, we will

## Use of LLMs

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='50%'}
- You _are_ allowed to use LLMs to **troubleshoot** your code
- I discourage you from asking your LLM to make the assignments for you
- At the end of this course you should be literate enough in R to do _some_ vibe coding
:::

::: {.column width='50%'}
- @becker2025:
  - 16 experienced software developers
  - 246 tasks assigned
  - How much time will you save using AI? (-24%)
  - AI randomized
  - How much do you think you saved using AI? (-20%)
  - Actual completion times with AI (+19%!)

## Motivation to learn scripting languages

- Reproducibility:Data and code are increasingly required by publishers
  - [Economics](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/data/data-code-policy)
  - [Natural sciences](https://www.nature.com/nature-portfolio/editorial-policies/reporting-standards)
- Efficiency and flexibility
- Scale: From small to medium data, it's all the same
- Responsibility:
  - We spend thousands of hours and dollars collecting data
  - Objective is to understand how the world works / improve the state of the world
  - Bad practices can erode all this away

## Our toolkit

- [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) will be our _engine for statistical computing_
- [**RStudio**](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) will be our _Integrated Development Environment_ (IDE)
- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/) will help us keep track of our code
- [**GitHub**](https://github.com/) will allow us to share our code with the world
- [**EVR628tools**](https://jcvdav.github.io/EVR628tools/) contains data and a few functions to support the course

. . .

::: {.callout-important collapse="true"}
# You should have already done this
::: {.nonincremental}
- Download and install the latest version of R (currently v 4.5.x) for [MacOS](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) or [Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
- Download and install the latest version of [RStudio Desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
- Full set of instructions available [here](https://jcvdav.github.io/EVR_628/docs/01_installing_R_RStudio.html).
:::
:::

## Why an IDE?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='50%'}
### Multiple platforms
- Keep data in Excel (needs microsoft license)
- Statistical analyses in some GUI (needs IBM SPSS license)
- Build figures in Tableau (needs license)
- Copy things to Powerpoint / Word (need....)
- Ooops, need to update my data...
:::

::: {.column width='50%'}
### R Studio
- Free and open-source
- One single platform to:
  - Talk to R, Python, SQL, html....
  - Maintain data, analysis, figures, and even text
- Cognitive costs of switching between screens
- There are other solutions (posit, VSCode, Cursor, Codium...)

:::

::::


## RStudio projects

- RStudio projects keep all files associated with a project together
- 1 folder = 1 project
- In my case, 1 paper = 1 project | 1 class = 1 project
- This entire course will be one project in your computer^[plus one more for your final project]
- A project tells R what the "working directory" is: where to find files
- Needs to live in your computer (not the cloud!)

## Learning Objectives - Revisited

:::{.callout-note}
# By the end of this week, you should be able to:
- Understand the difference between R and RStudio
- Open the RStudio IDE
- Identify the main work areas
- Start a project and a script
- Install R packages
:::

## Next class

- Introduction to RStudio IDE
- Changing the default settings
- Running your first lines of code
- Creating an RStudio project
- A few basics of project organization

# That's It for Today

(Unless you are having trouble installing R / RStudio)

# Getting to Know R Studio

## Announcements:

- This week only: Office Hours shifted to 10:15-12:00 **FRIDAY**
- [Software Carpentry](https://idsc.miami.edu/software-carpentry-workshops/) date TBD, but keep an eye

## Dynamics

- Post it on your screen means "I'm working on it"
- Post it down means "I'm ready to listen"
