# Introduction

## GIS vs Geocomputation

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

### GIS:

- Powerful
- Emphasize graphical user interface (GUI)
- You can only do what the developers allow you to do
- Difficult to reproduce

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

### Geocomputation:
- Just as powerful (same underlying code)
- Command line interface (CLI)
- Flexible
- Reproducible

> Academic research, software development and practical applications that use geographic data to solve problems, with a focus on reproducibility, flexibility and tool development. - Lovlace, Nowosad, Muenchow (GeocompR, 2024)

## How do we get the world into a computer?

- Imagine an attribute that occurs somewhere in the World:
    - SST
    - site identity
    - hurricane path
    - city boundaries
- How do we represent it?
- How do we work on it?
- How do we store the data?

## We need a *model*

Spatial data can be represented in a `vector` model, or a `raster` model

In today's class:

- Introduce the *why* behind each model
- Discuss where and when they are used
- Focus on `vector`:
    - It's main attributes
    - It's implementation in R
    
## Learning Objectives

:::{.callout-note}
# By the end of the lecture, you should be able to:

- list the two main data models, and articulate their main characteristics
- understand the principles of `vector` data
- list the three main components of a spatial `vector` object
- list the tree main types of a _simple feature_
- given an `sf` object, plot it and inspect it
:::



## Two models
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
### `vector`
- World is represented using geometries: points, lines, and polygons
- Discrete and well-defined borders = high precision
- Computationally intensive
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### `raster`
- Space is divided into equal-sized grid cells (or pixels)
- Aggregate spatial features to a given *resolution*
- You can lose some precision, but much faster to work with
:::

. . .

## Example: Rosenstiel {.scrollable}

:::: {.panel-tabset}

### Point

```{r point-example}
#| code-fold: true
# Build the "spatial" part
rsmaes_pt_coords <- st_point(x = c(-80.1632879, 25.7328129),
                             dim = "XY") |> 
  st_sfc(crs = 4326)
# Combine with the "attributes" part
rsmaes_pt <- st_sf(id = "Rosenstiel (point)",
                   geometry = rsmaes_pt_coords)
# Visualize
m <- mapview(rsmaes_pt) 
m@map |> leaflet::setView(lng = -80.16328, lat = 25.73281, zoom = 17)
```

### Line (2D)

```{r line-example}
#| code-fold: true
rsmaes_line_coords <- st_linestring(
  x = matrix(data = c(-80.163017, 25.733950,
                      -80.164236, 25.732816,
                      -80.163772, 25.732353,
                      -80.163924, 25.732148,
                      -80.163455, 25.731597,
                      -80.162187, 25.731605,
                      -80.160968, 25.732172,
                      -80.163017, 25.733950),
             ncol = 2,
             byrow = T),
  dim = "XY") |> 
  list() |> 
  st_sfc(crs = 4326)

rsmaes_line <- st_sf(id = "Rosenstiel (line)",
                     geometry = rsmaes_line_coords)

m <- mapview(rsmaes_line)
m@map |> leaflet::setView(lng = -80.16328, lat = 25.73281, zoom = 17)
```

### Polygon (3D)

```{r polygon-example}
#| code-fold: true
rsmaes_poly_coords <- st_polygon(
  x = list(
    matrix(
      data = c(
        -80.163017, 25.733950,
        -80.164236, 25.732816,
        -80.163772, 25.732353,
        -80.163924, 25.732148,
        -80.163455, 25.731597,
        -80.162187, 25.731605,
        -80.160968, 25.732172,
        -80.163017, 25.733950),
      ncol = 2,
      byrow = T)),
  dim = "XY") |> 
  st_sfc(crs = 4326)

rsmaes_poly <- st_sf(id = "Rosenstiel (polygon)",
                     geometry = rsmaes_poly_coords)

m <- mapview(rsmaes_poly)
m@map |> leaflet::setView(lng = -80.16328, lat = 25.73281, zoom = 17)
```


### Raster
```{r raster-example}
#| code-fold: true
rsmaes_rast <- rasterize(
  x = vect(rsmaes_poly),
  y = rast(resolution = 0.0001,
           crs = "EPSG:4326",
           val = 0,
           xmin = -80.168, xmax = -80.155,
           ymin = 25.730, ymax = 25.735),
  field = 1)

names(rsmaes_rast) <- "Rosenstiel"
rsmaes_rast[is.na(rsmaes_rast)] <- 0

m <- mapview(rsmaes_rast, legend = F)
m@map |> leaflet::setView(lng = -80.16328, lat = 25.73281, zoom = 17)
```

## Common uses
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
### `vector`
- Common in social sciences:
    - Census tract boundaries
    - Political boundaries
    - Roads
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### `raster`
- Common in natural sciences:
    - Sea surface temperature
    - Satellite imagery
    - Species distribution models
:::

::::

- As environmental scientists and practitioners we will typically use both

- The "correct" type of data varies by use case

. . . 

> "`raster` is faster, but `vector` is 'correcter'"

## Vector data model

> World is represented using geometries: points, lines, and polygons

. . .

**Q:** What is a line? What is a polygon?

. . .

**A:** A sequence of points

. . .

**Q:** How do we represent a point?

. . .

**A:** Coordinates

. . .

**Q:** What are coordinates?

. . .

**A:** Two numbers representing distance from an **origin**: a coordinate reference system


# What is where? And what does "where" mean?

Coordinates, Coordinate Reference Systems, and Attributes

## What does "where" mean?


Consider the following two coordinates:

- `(-80.1632879, 25.7328129)`

- `(1186764, 2863941)`

. . .

Where are they?

. . .

```{r, echo=FALSE}
USA <- rnaturalearth::ne_states(geounit = "United States of America") |> 
  filter(!name %in% c("Hawaii", "Alaska"))

FL <- USA |> 
  filter(name == "Florida")

MEX <- rnaturalearth::ne_countries(country = "Mexico")

rsmaes_pt_coords <- st_point(x = c(-80.1632879, 25.7328129),
                             dim = "XY") |> 
  st_sfc(crs = "EPSG:4326")

p1 <- ggplot() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  geom_sf(data = FL) +
  geom_sf(data = rsmaes_pt_coords)

p2 <- p1 + 
  coord_sf(crs = "EPSG:26916",
           datum = st_crs("EPSG:26916")) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))

cowplot::plot_grid(p1, p2, ncol = 2, rel_widths = c(3.5, 1))
```

## The importance of attributes

- Coordinates and a CRS are enough to place the point on a map
- Also enough to perform spatial analysis
- But not enough to convey *information* about the location
- Often not enough to derive insights
- We also need attributes

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
The three main components of a spatial `vector` object are attributes (what), geometry, and CRS (where)
:::

## Attributes

- Are not inherently spatial
- Can be a discrete or categorical variable representing a characteristic of interest:
    - Identity
    - Sea Surface Temperature
    - Time
- Note that you can have more than one attribute tied to a geometry
    - 2 attributes: vessel-tracking data or hurricane path (id and time)
    - 2+ attributes: Buoy weather data (id, time, and all variables measured)

# Handling spatial data in a computer

## How are these compotents handled in a computer?

We rely on four key low-level libraries for geocomputation:

- `GDAL`: read, write, and manipulating geographic data
- `PROJ`: coordinate system transformation
- `GEOS`: **planar** geometry engine only to be used with data with a _projected_ CRS)
- **`S2`**: a **spherical** geometry engine, written in C++ (fast) and developed by Google (reliable)
- None of these are R packages

. . .

All are incredibly powerful and open source, but not exactly user-friendly

## Ways of interacting with these libraries

![](img/cli_and_gui.png)
. . .

From R, our main point of access will be the `sf` package

## The `sf` package

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='40%'}
![](img/sf_logo.png)
`{sf}`: a package that provides simple features access for R

:::

::: {.column width='60%'}
`{sf}` provides:

- A consistent command-line interface to communicate with the libraries
- Tidyverse-like access to attributes data (`dplyr` and `tidyr`)
- Visualization of attribute and spatial data (`geom_sf()`)
- Spatial and geometry operations

::: {.fragment}

When we load `sf`, it automatically links to these low level libraries

```{.r}
library(sf)
```

```
Linking to GEOS 3.13.0, GDAL 3.10.0, PROJ 9.5.1; sf_use_s2() is TRUE
```

# Introduction to Simple Features

## Simple Features

- Simple features is an official, open  standard [ISO 19125](https://www.iso.org/standard/40114.html)
- Hierarchical data model to represent types of geometries (_i.e._ points, lines, polygons, multi-*, and collections)

. . .

The standard says: 

> “A simple feature is defined by the OpenGIS Abstract specification to have both spatial and non-spatial attributes. Spatial attributes are geometry valued, and simple features are based on 2D geometry with linear interpolation between vertices.”

—Pebesma, 2024

## Quick example 1: inspecting `sf` objects

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| fig-width: 6
library(EVR628tools)
data("data_milton_sf") # Load
class(data_milton_sf) # Inspect it
dim(data_milton_sf) # Dimensions
head(data_milton_sf)
```

## Quick example 2: Visually inspecting `sf` objects

```{r}
plot(data_milton_sf) # Plot it
```

Note you get one plot per column (variable), except for geometry

## Quick example 3: An `sf` object is just a `data.frame` / `tibble` {.scrollable}

You can quickly calculate summary statistics for any attribute variable (i.e. column)

```{r}
summary(data_milton_sf$wind_speed)
```

. . .

Keep only some columns

```{r}
milton_light <- data_milton_sf |> 
  select(iso_time, wind_speed)
milton_light
```

. . .

geometry columns are "sticky"


## Quick example 4: Yes, `sf` objects play along with `ggplot`

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='50%'}
Either for the spatial data

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "|2|"
ggplot(data = milton_light) +
  geom_sf() +
  labs(x = "Lon",
       y = "Lat")
```

:::

::: {.column width='50%'}
::: {.fragment}
Or the attribute variables

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "|2-3|"
ggplot(data = milton_light,
       mapping = aes(x = iso_time,
                     y = wind_speed)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Date",
       y = "Wind speed (knots)")
```
:::
:::
::::


# Why simple features?

## Why use simple features

- **STANDARD** = transferability and reproducibility
- Widely supported data model (e.g. QGIS and PostGIS)
- Relatively quick I/O
- Full R support: `sf` objects can be treated as data.frames (wrangling and visualization, pipe-friendly)

# Visualizing simple features

(Just an overview for now)

## Basic maps

You can specify you only want one panel

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
USA <- rnaturalearth::ne_states(geounit = "United States of America") |> 
  filter(!name %in% c("Hawaii", "Alaska"))

plot(USA, max.plot = 1)
```

## Other parameters to `plot()`

Or that you specifically want a column (either by name or by position)

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
plot(USA["name"])
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
plot(USA[,18])
```

:::

::::

. . .

- These are mainly helpful as check for ourselves
- You won't always get a legend

## Adding layers

Use `reset = FALSE` and `add = TRUE`

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='50%'}
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| code-line-numbers: "|1|2-4|"
plot(USA[,1], reset = F)
plot(FL, add = T, col = "orange")
plot(data_milton_sf, add = T, col = "red")
plot(MEX, add = T, col = "gray")
```
:::

::: {.column width='50%'}
- `reset = FALSE` needed when plotting the first layer produces a key OR the extent needs to be updated as new layers come in
- See `?sf::plot_sf()` for more details
:::

::::




## Basic = limitations

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

Base `plot()` is great for:

- Rapidly visualizing your data (just a few lines of code)
- Checking correspondence between layers

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

Base `plot()` is terrible for:

- Building complex visualizations (including formal maps)

:::
::::

. . .

We will cover visualization in more detail in a few weeks. In the meantime, two quick ways

## Visualizing `sf` objects with `ggplot`

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
p <- ggplot(data = USA) +
  geom_sf(fill = "gray90")

p
```

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
p +
  geom_sf(data = FL, fill = "orange") +
  geom_sf(data = data_milton_sf,
          mapping = aes(color = wind_speed), size = 1) +
  geom_sf(data = MEX)
```
:::
::::

This is what I use to build 99% of my maps, including those for publications and proposals

## Visualizing `sf` objects with `mapview`

- Just like `plot()`, `mapview()` produces quick visualizations
- Customization is painful, but worth it for communication

. . .

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
mapview(list(USA, FL, data_milton_sf, MEX))
```

This is what I use to interactively explore my data

:::{.callout-note}
For now, recall that you can quickly visualize sf objects using `plot()`, `ggplot()`, or `mapview()`
:::

# Geometry types

## The main types of simple features

::::{columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

::: {style="font-size: 75%"}

- `POINT`	zero-dimensional geometry containing a single point
- `LINESTRING`	sequence of points connected by straight, non-self intersecting line pieces; one-dimensional geometry
- `POLYGON`	geometry with a positive area (two-dimensional); sequence of points form a closed, non-self intersecting ring; the first ring `denotes` the exterior ring, zero or more subsequent rings denote holes in this exterior ring
- `MULTIPOINT`	set of points
- `MULTILINESTRING`	set of linestrings
- `MULTIPOLYGON`	set of polygons
- `GEOMETRYCOLLECTION` set of geometries of any type except `GEOMETRYCOLLECTION`

 <!-- Other less common types include `CIRCULARSTRING`, `COMPOUNDCURVE`, `CURVEPOLYGON`, `MULTICURVE`, `MULTISURFACE`, `CURVE`, `SURFACE`, `POLYHEDRALSURFACE`, `TIN` -->

:::{.callout-note}

Both are `sf` objects, which are `data.frames` /`tibbles` with a special column called `geometry`

:::

. . .

Let's dive deeper into how an object of class `sf` is made

# The `sf` class

## An `sf` object

Two main parts: geometries (spatial) and attributes (non-geographic)

![GeoCompR, 2024 - Rhomboids are functions, rectangles are objects](https://r.geocompx.org/images/02-sfdiagram.png)

. . .

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| code-line-numbers: "1|2|3|4-6"
rsmaes_pt <- c(-80.1632879, 25.7328129) |>      # Coordinates
  st_point() |>                                 # Build sfg
  st_sfc(crs = "ESRI:4326") |>                  # Build sfc (an specify CRS)
  st_sf(                                        # Build sf
    data.frame(id = "Rosenstiel (point)",       # Add the data.frame portion
               foundation = 1943))        
```

. . .

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
rsmaes_pt
```


## Simple feature geometries (`sfg`)

- These are the essential building blocks
- They represent the type of simple features that can be handled in R
- There is one function to create each type
- You will rarely use them
- They take numbers, matrices, or lists as inputs
- Do not hold information on CRS

## Simple feature columns (`sfc`)

- A collection of 1 + `sfg` objects
- Its contents may be more than one type of geometry (e.g. points and polygons)
- Can contain a CRS, but must be the same across all geometries

# Spherical geometries

## What are spherical geometries?

- Most software used to perform spatial operations assumes planar (e.g. projected) geometries
- But our world is not flat
- Therefore, when working with planar geometries, your choice of projection can influence your calculations
- Using spherical geometries can bypass this
- Spherical geometries are turned on by default (`sf_use_s2(TRUE)`)

## What do spherical geometries do?

S2 geometry assumes that straight lines between points on the globe are not formed by straight lines in the equirectangular projection, but by great circles: the shortest path over the sphere. 

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
mex <- st_point(c(-99.165852, 19.376395)) |>
  st_sfc(crs = 4326)
ams <- st_point(c(4.646219, 52.38739)) |>
  st_sfc(crs = 4326)

# What is the distance between these points?
st_distance(mex, ams)

sf_use_s2(F) # Turn off spherical geometries
st_distance(mex, ams)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
sf_use_s2(T)
```

## Why are they different?

One tries to calculate the distance along a straight (red) line. The other does so along the "curved" (black) line. On a sphere, the black line is shorter.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
route <- st_linestring(rbind(c(-99.165852, 19.376395),
                             c(4.646219, 52.38739))) |> 
  st_sfc(crs = 4326)

route1 <- st_segmentize(route,
                        units::set_units(10, km))

ggplot(data = rnaturalearth::ne_countries()) +
  geom_sf(fill = "gray90",
          linewidth = 0.1) +
  geom_sf(data = route, color = "red") +
  geom_sf(data = route1, color = "black")
```

## Which one is right?

![In reality](img/mex-amsterdam.png)

# Wrap up

## Main points
1. There are two models with which we represent spatial data (`vector` and `raster`)
2. The `vector` model relies on `simple features`: points, lines, and polygons (coordinates)
3. `sf` is the main R package for working with vector data
4. an `sf` object should have three things:
    - attributes (what: data frame)
    - features (where: geometry column)
    - CRS (in relation to what?: in the header)
5. `sf` objects can be treated like `tibbles` / `data.frames`
6. Quickly visualize sf objects using `plot()`, `ggplot()`, or `mapview()`

## BEFORE Next class
