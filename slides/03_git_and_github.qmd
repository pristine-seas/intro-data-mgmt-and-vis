## Learning Objectives

:::{.callout-note}
## By the end of this week, you should be able to:
- Understand the importance of reproducibility
- Create the basic structure for an organized project
- Explain the difference between Git and GitHub
- Create and "clone" a "repo"
- "commit" and "push"
:::

. . .

:::{.callout-warning}
## Learning Git and GitHub may (will) be painful

- Usually taught later in courses
- Limited use if you learn it at the end
- I would rather push materials to later in the course, but have you dominate this
:::

## Today's Agenda

- **Reproducible Research**
- **File Structure & Organization**
- **Version Control with Git**
- **GitHub & Collaboration**
- **Hands-on: Building Your Repository**

# Version control and reproducibility

## Why Should You Care?

- Career advancement: Version control is a required skill in data science
  - Example job postings [industry](https://jobs.schmidtmarine.org/companies/global-fishing-watch/jobs/35650809-data-scientist-vessel-tracking-and-behavior-remote), [academia](https://jobs.chronicle.com/job/37833047/post-doctoral-fellow-plant-ecology/), and [government](https://nmfs-opensci.github.io/GitHub-Guide/)
- Collaboration: Work with others without breaking each other's code
- Reproducibility: Essential for scientific integrity / managing the real world
- Backup & recovery: Never lose your work again
- Portfolio building: Showcase your projects to employers


## The Problem: Research can be chaotic

- File naming: `analysis_final_v2_really_final_USE_THIS_ONE.R`
  - (And the filenames contained might look even worse)
- Lost work: "Where did I put that working version?"
- Collaboration conflicts: "Who changed what and when?"
- Reproducibility failures: "It worked on my computer!"
- Publication delays: "I can't reproduce my own results"


## Reproducible Research

Research that can be repeated by others using the same data and methods

. . .

**Key Components:**

- Data: Raw, processed, and metadata
- Code: Scripts, functions, and workflows  
- Documentation: Methods, assumptions, and decisions
- Environment: Software versions and dependencies
- Results: Outputs, tables, figures


## The Reproducibility Crisis

- 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments [@Baker2016-aa]
- 50% of researchers have failed to reproduce their own experiments [@Baker2016-aa]
- $28 billion wasted annually on irreproducible preclinical research [@Freedman2015-aa]
- Environmental science is not immune to these issues


## Real-World Example: Climate Data Analysis

**Scenario**: You're analyzing sea surface temperature trends

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='40%'}
**Without version control**:

- Multiple versions of scripts with unclear differences
- No record of data processing steps
- Can't track which parameters produced which results
- Collaboration becomes chaotic
:::

::: {.column width='60%'}
**With version control**:

- Clear history of all changes
- Reproducible workflow from raw data to final results
- Easy collaboration and peer review
- Confidence in your results
:::

::::





## File Structure Fundamentals

:::{.callout-important}
Good file organization is the foundation of reproducible research
:::

**Principles**:

- Consistency: Use the same structure across projects
- Clarity: Names should be self-explanatory
- Separation: Keep raw data, processed data, and outputs separate
- Documentation: Include README files and metadata


## Recommended Project Structure

```
project_name/
├── data/
│   ├── raw/           # Original, unmodified data
│   ├── processed/     # Cleaned, transformed data
|   └── output/        # Output from your analyses
├── scripts/
│   ├── 01_processing/
│   ├── 02_analysis/
│   └── 03_contents/
├── results/
│   ├── figures/
│   ├── tables/
├── docs/              # Documents
├── slides/            # Slides
├── README.md          # Project overview
└── .gitignore         # Files to exclude from version control
```

## Example

## File Naming Best Practices

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='50%'}
**DO**:

- Use descriptive names: `sea_surface_temp_analysis.R`
  - I prefer `snake_case`, but `CamelCase` is appropriate too
- Use consistent separators: underscores or hyphens
:::

::: {.column width='50%'}
**DON'T**:

- Use spaces: `my file.R`
- Use special characters: `analysis@final.R`
- Use vague names: `stuff.R`
- Use different naming conventions within the same project
- Use versions for code `analysis_v1.2.R` = `analysis_final_v2_really_final_USE_THIS_ONE.R`
:::

::::

. . .

Sometimes: include dates (e.g. `data_2024_01_15.csv`) 

## What is Version Control?

A system that tracks changes to files over time

**Think of it as**:

- A time machine for your code
- A detailed history book of your project
- A safety net for your work
- A collaboration tool for teams

## An example

- [`mex_ports` repository](https://github.com/mex-fisheries/mex_ports)
  - I [created](https://github.com/mex-fisheries/mex_ports/commit/8c4a903e66d331b47eff18119b142ac500e1076a) a new R script on August 1st
  - Emma (student intern) [worked](https://github.com/mex-fisheries/mex_ports/commits/main/) on other files in the repo Aug 5 - Aug 11
  - Emma was having trouble reading data I had created
  - I had made a [minor](https://github.com/mex-fisheries/mex_ports/commit/f599235f81426c3778750effe24110f883ebee54) mistake, which I fixed

- Note how I simply overwrite the file
- No need to have V1 (didn't work) and V2 (works) in the same repo
- If I ever want to go back to an earlier version, I [can](https://github.com/mex-fisheries/mex_ports/commit/8c4a903e66d331b47eff18119b142ac500e1076a)!

## Git vs GitHub

:::: {.columns}

- Something you install in your computer
- A command line tool (but we can bypass that)
:::

::: {.column width='50%'}
### Git**Hub**

- A service (offered by Microsoft)
- Lives "on the cloud"
- Provides a graphical interface
- How you connect your computer to your colleague's computer
- Back up of your code

## Git vs GitHub

![Source: https://www.edureka.co/blog/git-vs-github/](img/git_gitHub.png)

## Git

**Git** was created by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) (creator of Linux) in 2005

**Key Features**:

- Free and open source: No licensing costs
- Fast: Most operations are local
- Branching: Work on features without affecting main code
- Merging: Combine changes from different sources
- The Most Popular Version Control System

# Four Git concepts

Repository

Clone

Commit

Push / Pull

## Git Concepts: The Repository

**Repository (repo)**: A directory containing your project and its complete history

. . .


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='50%'}
**Think of it as**:

- A project folder with superpowers
- A database of all your changes
- A collaboration space for your team
:::

::: {.column width='50%'}
**Types**:

- Local repository: On your computer
- Remote repository: On a server (like GitHub)
:::

::::

. . .

:::{.callout-tip}
# Example

- The folder on my computer called `mex_ports` is the local repo
- What you saw [online](https://github.com/mex-fisheries/mex_ports) was the remote repo
- 1 folder = 1 RStudio project = 1 repo
:::


## Git Concepts: Cloning

**Cloning**: The process of bringing a repo from the remote to local for _the first time_

. . .

**When you clone a repo**:

- You get all files available in the remote, at that point in time
- You only do this once per project (unless you have more than one computer)
- RStudio has a nice way of doing it without having to use the command line
- Cloning is just GitHub's way of referring to "download and connect remote to local"


## Git Concepts: Commits

**Commit**: A snapshot of your project at a specific point in time

. . .

**Each commit contains**:

- Changes: What files were modified
- Message: Description of what was changed and why
- Author: Who made the changes
- Timestamp: When the changes were made
- Unique ID: A hash that identifies this commit

. . .

**Think of commits as**:

- Checkpoints in your project's history
- Save points in a video game
- Pages in a project's storybook

. . .

![](img/commit_example.png){.absolute top="50" right="10"}
## Git Concepts: Push / Pull

Refers to uploading and downloading changes to and from the remote

- With a push, you decide when you send a bundle of commits
- With a pull, you decide when you bring down your colleague's version of code

## Git Workflow: The Basic Cycle

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='60%'}
1. **Modify** files in your working directory
2. **Stage** changes you want to commit
3. **Commit** staged changes with a message
4. **Repeat** as you work on your project
:::

::: {.column width='40%'}
![](img/stage.png)
:::

::::

. . .

**Push** the changes up to GitHub

**This cycle creates a timeline of your project's development**


## Git Commands: The Essentials

We can do most things in RStudio, but you should know:

. . .

- Getting started
  - `git init`: Create a new repository
  - `git clone`: Copy a repository from remote to local
- Daily workflow
  - `git status`: See what's changed
  - `git add`: Stage changes for commit
  - `git commit`: Save changes with a message
- Connecting with GitHub
  - `git push`: Upload changes to remote repository
  - `git pull`: Download changes from remote repository

## When / What to commit

- No specific rule
- Whatever a "change" might look like
- Sometimes `Added color to points in figure 2` is enough (one line in one file)
- Sometimes `Refactored code to work with new package` is appropriate (many lines in many files)
- Small commits and frequent commits are best

## Writing Good Commit Messages

**Good commit messages**:

- Are descriptive and specific
- Explain WHAT and/or WHY and/or HOW things changed
- Are concise but informative

. . .

**Examples**:

- `Add sea surface temperature data processing function`
- `Fix bug in monthly trend calculation`
- `Update README with installation instructions`
- `stuff`
- `fixed things`


## GitHub: The Social Platform for Code

**GitHub** is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories (including this course)

**Key Features**:

- Free hosting for public repositories
- Collaboration tools: Issues, pull requests, discussions, [contact](https://github.com/chaisemartinPackages/did_multiplegt_dyn/issues/99) authors
- Project management: Wikis, project boards, releases
- Integration: Connects with other tools and services
- **Portfolio: Showcase your work to potential employers**


## GitHub Workflows

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='50%'}
By yourself

- **Clone**: Download the repository to your computer
- **Commit**: Make and save your changes
- **Push**: Upload your changes to GitHub

:::



::: {.column width='50%'}
In a group

- **Clone**: Download the repository to your computer
- **Branch**: Create a separate line of development
- **Commit**: Make and save your changes
- **Push**: Upload your changes to GitHub
- **Pull Request**: Propose changes to the original repository
- **Review**: Get feedback and approval from collaborators
- **Merge**: Integrate approved changes into the main project
:::

## Best Practices for Research Repositories

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='50%'}
**Structure**:

- Clear README with project description and documentation
- Well-organized file structure

**Content**:

- Include raw and processed data
- Include all your code

:::

::: {.column width='50%'}
**Collaboration**:

- Use descriptive commit messages
- Review code before merging
- Maintain consistent coding standards
- Document decisions and assumptions

**Files that you don't want on GitHub:**

- Files larger than 100 MB
- Files containing passwords / authentication tokens
- Binary files (.docx, .xlsx, .ppt...)
:::

::::

## GitHub vs DropBox/Box/GoogleDrive...

- Designed for the intended task
- **You** have _granular_ control over what is updated and when
- Allows multiple versions of same project to evolve in parallel
  - e.g. Your pipeline is done, mine isn't yet

## Questions & Discussion

- How might version control help in your research?
- What challenges do you anticipate with Git?
- How can we ensure reproducibility in environmental science?
- What are the benefits of open science and sharing code?
